Description: Flask-CAS
        =========
        
        Flask-CAS is a Flask extension which makes it easy to
        authenticate with a CAS.
        
        CAS
        ===
        
        The Central Authentication Service (CAS) is a single sign-on 
        protocol for the web. Its purpose is to permit a user to access 
        multiple applications while providing their credentials (such as 
        userid and password) only once. It also allows web applications 
        to authenticate users without gaining access to a user's security 
        credentials, such as a password. The name CAS also refers to a 
        software package that implements this protocol. 
        
        (Very short) Setup Tutorial
        ===========================
        
        First create a Flask instance:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from flask import Flask
        
            app = Flask(__name__)
        
        Apply CAS on your Flask instance:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from flask.ext.cas import CAS
        
            CAS(app)
        
        Do needed configuration:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            app.config['CAS_SERVER'] = 'https://sso.pdx.edu' 
        
            app.config['CAS_AFTER_LOGIN'] = 'route_root'
        
        Using
        =====
        
        After you setup you will get two new routes `/login/`
        and `/logout/`.
